# Robo-Arm
My journey creating a robotic arm

## Goal
To create a robotic arm with 4 Degrees of Freedom (3 Planar + 1 Rotation at the base)

## Project Structure
* Root Directory: contains CMake files for building and `.ioc` file from STM32CubeMx. The `.ioc` contains configuration used by STM32CubeMx for its code generation.
* `Core/`: contains the code generated by STM32CubeMx. Also contains `main.c`, in which we redirect the control flow to our own in `Application/`
* `Application/`: contains code specific to the application. I.e. hardware control, inverse kinematics, etc.
* `Drivers/`: generated by STM32CubeMx
* `ThirdParty/FreeRTOS`: contains FreeRTOS and importantly `FreeRTOSConfig.h`


TODO: sketch

## Software Architecture
TODO:

## Inverse Kinematics
TODO: maths

## Hardware
* SG90 Servo, positioned using 5V PWM signal
* Level Shifter for shifting PWM signal from 3.3V board level to 5V servo level
* TODO: stm32 board description

## Building
TODO: More detailed steps
Cross-Compile using CMake for ARM using: `arm-none-eabi-gcc` toolchain

## Debugging
On-board Debugging can be done using OpenOCD using the config `st_nucleo_f4.cfg` in the root directory
